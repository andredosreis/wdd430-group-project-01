# WDD430 Group Project – Week 5 Progress Report

**Date:** 12 Aug 2025
**Participants:** André dos Reis, Sydrick Newton

---

## Meeting Summary

* **Challenge:** Expand the GitHub board to 10 + granular tasks and migrate code styling from Tailwind v4 (beta) to the stable v3 while keeping development uninterrupted.
* **Success:** Deployed the `/customers` route with a searchable list (mock data) and restored full Tailwind styling after downgrading to v3.
* **Insight:** Maintaining a stable toolchain (Tailwind v3) saved hours of troubleshooting and let us focus on feature delivery.

## ⚠️ Challenges

1. **Board Expansion** – Creating and organising 10 + cards to satisfy Week 5 grading criteria.
2. **Toolchain Downgrade** – Rolling back from Tailwind v4 preview to v3 without losing progress.
3. **Solo Workflow** – Balancing coding, reviewing, and project management tasks as a single‑member team.

## ✅ Successes

1. Added **Customers List** with live search at `/customers` using typed TypeScript.
2. Expanded GitHub Project Board to 12 cards; moved two new tasks to *Done* this week.
3. Restored full Tailwind styling (v3) and ensured CSS loads correctly across all pages.

## 💡 Insights

1. **Stable > Bleeding‑Edge** – Up‑to‑date but stable libraries speed development more than beta features.
2. **Component Reuse** – The list/filter component reused again for customers, confirming modular design pays off.
3. **Board Granularity** – Smaller cards make solo work visible and keep momentum high.
