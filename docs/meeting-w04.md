## ⚠️ Challenges

1. **Scope Realignment** – Replacing invoice‑centric screens with product‑centric ones to match the “Handcrafted Haven” brief.
2. **Time Constraint** – Migrating components while keeping the existing weekly deadline.
3. **Single‑Member Team Logistics** – Handling every role (dev, reviewer, PM) solo and documenting a peer‑review for one.

## ✅ Successes

1. Implemented the **`/products`** route with mocked list & category filter (furniture / kitchenware / decor) using typed TypeScript.
2. Refactored navigation: Navbar links now point to `/products` and `/customers`, removing legacy invoice paths.
3. Set up a GitHub Project Board with >10 granular tasks, moving three to *Done* and one to *In Progress* this week.

## 💡 Insights

1. **Code Reusability** – The list/filter component for invoices was reused \~90 % for products, demonstrating the value of modular design.
2. **Early Typing Pays Off** – Adding `category` as a typed field surfaced data mismatches instantly in the editor.
3. **Board Visibility** – A detailed board compensates for the lack of multiple teammates by making progress explicit to the instructor.

## Next Steps

1. Add customer features: list, search, detail pages.
2. Prepare Week 5 meeting summary and expand board to cover customer tasks.
3. Complete individual peer‑feedback form in Canvas before the deadline.
