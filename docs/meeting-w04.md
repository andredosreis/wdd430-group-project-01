## ⚠️ Challenge

Align the project scope with the “Handcrafted Haven” brief (replace invoice screens with handmade‑product screens).

## ✅ Success

Implemented the **`/products`** route with a mocked list and category filter (furniture / kitchenware / decor) using typed TypeScript.

## 💡 Insight

The list + filter code first built for invoices could be reused (\~90 %) for products, saving development time.
