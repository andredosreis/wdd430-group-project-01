## 3. Meeting Notes – Week 03

**Date:** August 02, 2025
**Time:** 18:00 (local)
**Attendees:** André dos Reis

**Agenda**

1. Review Next.js scaffold and Tailwind CSS integration
2. Scaffold global layout (NavBar & Footer)
3. Implement dynamic invoice routes and test pages
4. Plan meeting summary and clean up project board

**Decisions & Summary**

* **Scope Confirmed:** Completed the initial setup of Next.js (App Router + TypeScript + ESLint) and configured Tailwind CSS.
* **Challenge:** Configuring the `@tailwindcss/postcss` plugin for Turbopack compatibility to process `@tailwind base`, `@tailwind components`, and `@tailwind utilities` correctly.
* **Success:** Completed the Next.js scaffold in under 10 minutes; reviewed and refined the `NavBar` and `Footer` components; verified that the `/login`, `/invoices`, and `/invoices/[id]` routes are functional.
* **Insight:** Defining colors and fonts as variables in `tailwind.config.js` allows full use of utility classes and keeps `globals.css` minimal.
